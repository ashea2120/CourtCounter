# CE-450 Lab 3 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 3 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and Court Counter
 
This repo is for the following Practice Set:
- Lesson 3: Making an app interactive
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Utilized skills from previous labs to easily create onClick methods, but learned alternative ways in this lesson
* i.e. Make the handler first and then when in the XML file, Android Studio will list all methods in the corresponding activity
- Became more familiar with nesting Layouts and how to effectively draw out a plan before just diving into the XML 
- Brushed up on important and good Java programming practices:
* Globals vs. Locals
* Effective naming (I had to refractor my code at the end in order to make it more readable. If I had done that from the start, it would have saved me time...)
* Updating variables throughout code in various spots
- How to quickly add other XML elements if doing an app similar to this one (ie. copy + paste and just change names)
- Some values from the Udacity course for the XML weren't the same, so other alternatives had to be used. 
* Example: "Attribute fontFamily is only used in API level 16 and higher (current min is 15) Did you mean app:fontFamily?"
